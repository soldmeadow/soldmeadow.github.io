<h1 id="ict-for-consumption-vs-creation">ICT for Consumption Vs Creation</h1>

<p>In 2014 Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull gave a speech entitled The Importance of Tech Education in Our Schools (Turnbull, 2014).  In his speech Turnbull (2014) argued that in our modern times even young children had ICT capabilities, such as using an iPad, and the focus of education should move to teaching children to be creators rather than passive consumers of digital technologies.  Turnbull (2014) was largely paraphrasing the thoughts of US President Barack Obama who had admonished American students to “Don’t just play on your phone, program it’” Turnbull (2014).  Now, in 2017, we find Malcolm Turnbull’s sentiments encoded in the Australian Digital Technologies Curriculum which seeks to enable students to “become innovative creators of digital solutions” (ACARA, 2017).</p>

<p>Malcolm Turnbull was explicit in his view that a move to teaching students to become digital creators was driven by an economic imperative, specifically that jobs of the future will require these skills (Turnbull, 2014).  There is also the view that there are many technologies such as robotics, AI and 3d printing that are on the cusp of explosive growth and governments around the world desire to share in the economic benefits (Dougherty, 2016).</p>

<p>I’m happy to see this move towards an emphasis on digital creation, especially as I want to teach coding and my educational philosophy is aligned with constructivism and an emphasis on “learning by doing”.  However, I share the view of Blikstein and Worsley (2016) that we must be careful to emphasise the process of creation over the product of creation.  Blikstein (2013) coined the phrase “keychain syndrome” to describe a phenomenon he witnessed whereby students in a class were introduced to digital fabrication technologies with a simple keychain exercise, however, the students never wanted to progress beyond making the keychains as they received a massive return on their minimal time investment as people unfamiliar with the fabrication technology were amazed by their creations.  Keychain syndrome has since been adopted as a term to describe trivialised projects that are designed to be produced within tight time constraints but impress people unfamiliar with the technology involved (Martinez &amp; Stager, 2013).</p>

<p>I feel we must be careful in Australian schools to not overemphasise product over process.  Students need to be able to undertake meaningful, complex projects that can potentially fail so they can learn valuable skills such as creativity, innovation, persistence and problem solving.  To conclude, I would like to offer the example of <a href="http://codecamp.com.au/">Code Camp</a> as an example of where Australian schools should not head.  <a href="http://codecamp.com.au/">Code Camp</a> offers after school and school holiday programs that “teach kids to code”.  They utilise creator vs consumer rhetoric in their advertising and there is a heavy emphasis on the fact that children will have produced a working game at the end of their course.  To achieve such a goal the students are heavily scaffolded and guided down certain paths, there is little opportunity for divergent thinking.  I believe <a href="http://codecamp.com.au/">Code Camp</a> is an excellent example of keychain syndrome in action.  In contrast, <a href="http://coderdojowa.org.au/">CoderDojo</a> provides extra-curricular coding clubs but children choose their own project and are largely self-guided and I feel this is a better model for schools to follow.</p>
