<h1 id="video-game-development-for-learning">Video Game Development for Learning</h1>

<p>Developing video games was my entry point into the world of computer programming and I have many fond high school memories of spending time in the computer lab with my friends developing and playing our games.  We never felt like we were learning but with hindsight informed by studying teaching I see we were immersed in a social constructivist learning experience that many teachers would love to be able to orchestrate for their students.  My high school programming career was played out against the back drop of the golden age of arcade video games and needless to say video games and the surrounding culture was a large preoccupation for myself and my friends.  Again, with hindsight, I see how my engagement and motivation to program computer games was driven by my interest in playing video games outside of school.  Developing video games in high school was such a profound and enjoyable experience for me that I want to provide that experience for my students.</p>

<p>In our present day video games are still a major preoccupation for adolescents.  Granic, Lobel, and Engels (2014) report 91% of children aged between 2 and 17 in the United States play video games.  This staggering statistic is partly driven by mobile devices with every mobile phone now capable of playing games that would have astounded my high school self.  Even without mobile gaming the world of video games is an important facet of teenage culture.  The Australian Professional Standards for Teachers impels teachers to “Know students” (AITSL, 2012) and it could be argued that understanding important elements of teenage culture such as video games and music is essential to understanding teenage students.  The standards also task teachers with delivering engaging lessons (AITSL, 2012) and it is well accepted that lessons tied to students’ interests that connect meaningfully to their lives will increase student engagement (McDonald, 2013).</p>

<p>With computer programming, or coding, now a part of the Australian curriculum (ACARA, 2017) developing video games provides a wonderful opportunity to teach students this skill in a way that is engaging to them.  Papert (1998) also saw engaging students in video game development as a powerful means to teach them coding skills but more importantly as a basis for teaching them about learning.  Papert (1998) envisaged a future where children would develop video games as readily as they draw pictures or write stories.</p>

<p>Video game development also provides a great opportunity to reinforce math concepts.  A common complaint of high school mathematics students is that they can see no use for the concepts they are learning (Ellenberg, 2015).  However, many mathematics concepts can be directly applied in video games, particularly for 3d games.  For example, many people struggle to see the point of complex numbers (a number that includes an imaginary component that is the seemingly impossible square root of a negative number), however, complex numbers form the basis of quaternions which are widely used for describing rotations in 3d games.</p>

<p>Upon my first day of practicum as a pre-service teacher I was given my mentor’s timetable and was greatly pleased to see Game Design classes peppered throughout the week.  I have only attended one Game Design class to date but I was overjoyed to see a class of students deeply engaged in creating games and enthusiastically demonstrating their creations to me.  I recently learnt about the <a href="https://www.stemgames.org.au/">Australian STEM Video Game Challenge</a> which is a competition sponsored by ACER and encourages students to create and submit video games to the competition (Australian STEM Video Game Challenge, 2017) and will be encouraging my students to enter.  I now feel my dream to teach students video game development is within reach.</p>
