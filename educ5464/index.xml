      <description>&lt;p&gt;From Wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer,[2] is a sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball. It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries, making it the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular sport.[3][4][5][6] The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goalkeepers are the only players allowed to touch the ball with their hands or arms while it is in play and then only in their penalty area. Outfield players mostly use their feet to strike or pass the ball, but may use their head or torso to strike the ball instead. The team that scores the most goals by the end of the match wins. If the score is level at the end of the game, either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time and/or a penalty shootout depending on the format of the competition. The Laws of the Game were originally codified in England by The Football Association in 1863. Association football is governed internationally by the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA; French: Fédération Internationale de Football Association) which organises a World Cup every four years.[7]&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Piracy is typically an act of robbery or criminal violence at sea. The term can include acts committed on land, in the air, or in other major bodies of water or on a shore. It does not normally include crimes committed against persons traveling on the same vessel as the perpetrator (e.g. one passenger stealing from others on the same vessel). The term has been used throughout history to refer to raids across land borders by non-state agents.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;coding-as-a-literacy&#34;&gt;Coding as a Literacy&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;NMC/CoSN Horizon Report: 2016 K-12&lt;/em&gt; Becker, Freeman, Giessinger Hall, Cummins and Yuhnke (2016) report that coding, or computer programming, is increasingly being adopted in school curriculums around the world in response to economic factors and the belief that coding can assist with the development of a raft of fluencies that are often described using the term &amp;lsquo;21st century skills&amp;rsquo;.  Becker et al (2016) see this trend increasing into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Australia factors such as our falling PISA ranking and the desire to transition our economy from its reliance on resources spurred moves towards creating an innovation mindset and a STEM focus in schools.  Consequently coding is an integral part of the new Digital Technologies curriculum currently being introduced in Australian schools (!ACARA ref!).  Additionally, within Western Australia the recently elected Premier Mark McGowan has &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.markmcgowan.com.au/news/science-and-coding-in-schools-to-create-jobs-for-the-future-1303&#34;&gt;pledged $2 million dollars&lt;/a&gt; to fund the integration of coding into the school curriculum.  In short, coding has already arrived in the Western Australian education system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a pre-service ICT teacher who desires to teach coding this is an issue close to my heart.  I agree that coding can help develop 21st century skills but I believe it can be greatly beneficial to traditional skills as well and offers great possibilities when combined with other curriculum areas, particularly maths and science.  As far back as 1980 Seymour Papert wrote his seminal book Mindstorms where he argued for computers to be used as learning tools for children to become &amp;ldquo;builders of their own intellectual structures&amp;rdquo; (Papert, 1980).  Unfortunately, over time computer usage in schools evolved to something more mundane, far removed from what was imagined by Papert.  Coding in the curriculum may help unlock the true potential of computers for learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I&amp;rsquo;m extremely dubious about the economic claims made around coding.  For example, Becker et al (2016) quote a prediction made by code.org that by 2020 there will be 1,000,000 more computing jobs than computing graduates (presumably in the US).  This sounds impressive but code.org provide no evidence for how the statistic was calculated nor do they explain what a computing job is.  One problem with statistics around ICT employment is that they often conflate a wide range of jobs such as sales, support and facilities management with software development.  Additionally, there is evidence that the supposed talent shortage within America is actually a ploy to get approval to employ cheap foreign labour on H1-B visas, for example Weismann (2013).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst the introduction of coding into schools is exciting and offers many great possibilities we need to be clear on why we are doing it.  We are inevitably lead to the question of what is the purpose of education.  Is the role of schools to train students for future jobs?  If this is the reason for the introduction of coding then we need to be honest and realistic about future job prospects but hopefully coding in the curriculum can be justified on more than purely economic grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
